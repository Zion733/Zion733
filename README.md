- âš¡ Fun fact: The first computer bug was an actual bug! In 1947, engineers working on the Harvard Mark II computer found that a moth had gotten trapped in one of the relays,causing a malfunction. They removed the moth and taped it into the logbook with the note, "First actual case of bug being found." This is where the term "debugging" comes from!
